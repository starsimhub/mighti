Code of Conduct
===============

Our pledge
==========

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the MIGHTI project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our standards
=============

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., addresses) without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Our responsibilities
====================

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove or reject contributions (e.g., comments, commits, issues) that violate this Code of Conduct, and to ban contributors for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
=====

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or community. Representation may include using an official project email address, posting via an official account, or serving as a representative at an event.

Enforcement
===========

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **info@starsim.org**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, with confidentiality maintained as appropriate.

Maintainers not acting in good faith may face disciplinary action, including removal from the project.
